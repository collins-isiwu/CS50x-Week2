# Readability
Readability is a C program that takes a text and determines its reading level. For example, if user types in a line of text from Dr. Seuss, the program should behave as follows:
$ ./readability
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
A number of “readability tests” have been developed over the years that define formulas for computing the reading level of a text.
 One such readability test is the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

** index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 **
